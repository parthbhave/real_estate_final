- Currently, Route to Controller communication is not working

- Data migrations worked on a sample table on my computer using Laravel installed on top of XAMPP

- So I have created a prototype with code and written about design decisions - some code is commented out

- Important files -

	- /app/http/routes.php - HTTP routes to controllers
	- /app/http/Kernel.php - contains scheduled task XML parser
	- /app/http/Controllers/ListingController.php - controllers for this application
	- /app/http/Controllers/Controller.php - controllers base class
	- /database/migrations/2014_10_12_000000_create_listing_photos_table.php - migration to create listing and photo tables

- Database schema design -

	- 2 tables - listing and photo
	- photo table is one row per photo tag along with foreign key listingId
	- listing table is one row per listing tag - includes address columns as well
